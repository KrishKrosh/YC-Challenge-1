Currently, antd does not work on a traditional IDE, because of a bug in momentum. Due to this, I was forced to solve this problem on CodeSandBox which can be found at https://codesandbox.io/s/github/KrishKrosh/YC-Challenge-1

The website is best viewed on a separate tab, so the webpage can be seen fully without being limited by the CodeSandBox IDE.

Design wise, this project is definitely not the best, however I was just learning React and wanted to win the challenge so I prioritized speed over stability.
Known Bugs:
  - Multiple errors when screens are loading
  - When checking in or checking out an attendee, the button may need to be pressed multiple times to change
  - Attendee List Page must be opened from the Home Page, or else an error will be thrown
